# RoadTrip Migration Guide: Vanilla JS → React + Vite + TailwindCSS

## How to Use This Guide

- [x] **Progress Tracking**: Check off items as you complete them using `- [x]`
- [x] **Sequential Order**: Follow phases in order, but items within a phase can be done in parallel
- [x] **Sub-tasks**: Complete all sub-items before marking the parent item as done
- [x] **Testing**: Test each component as you build it before moving to the next
- [x] **Commits**: Make frequent commits after completing each major item

## Rollback Plan

If migration needs to be rolled back:

1. Keep original `src/` directory until migration is complete
2. Maintain original build process until new one is verified
3. Test both versions in parallel during migration
4. Have deployment rollback strategy ready
