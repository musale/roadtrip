  - Error handling and loading states
  - Mode switching and map controls
  - GPS status management

#### 2. LiveHUD.jsx (Canvas-based Real-time Display)
- **Purpose**: 60fps animated overlay showing trip statistics
- **Features**:
  - High-DPI canvas support with devicePixelRatio scaling
  - Real-time statistics rendering (speed, distance, time, max speed)
  - Neon-themed visual design with brand colors
  - 60fps animation loop using requestAnimationFrame
  - Recording indicator with pulsing effect
  - Accessibility support with ARIA live regions
  - Auto start/stop animation based on recording state

#### 3. MapView.jsx (Interactive Map Component)
- **Purpose**: Real-time GPS track visualization with MapLibre GL
- **Features**:
  - MapLibre GL integration with vector tiles
  - Canvas fallback for offline/error scenarios
  - Real-time GPS track rendering with polyline
  - Current position marker with accuracy circles
  - Follow mode for auto-centering on position
  - Fit-to-bounds functionality for entire trip
  - Touch-friendly map controls
  - Nairobi-centered default location
  - Update throttling for performance (100ms)

#### 4. CameraView.jsx (Video Feed Component)
- **Purpose**: Camera access and video stream display
- **Features**:
  - getUserMedia API integration
  - Permission handling with status detection
  - Multi-camera device support with switching
  - Mobile-optimized constraints (1080p, 30fps, back camera preferred)
  - Error handling for various failure modes
  - Auto-retry functionality
  - Mirror effect for front camera (user-friendly)
  - Resolution display and device info

#### 5. App.jsx (Refactored Main Component)
- **Purpose**: Clean orchestration using context and components
- **Features**:
  - Context provider integration
  - Component composition (CameraView + LiveHUD or MapView)
  - Unified control bar with mode switching
  - Status bar with GPS and recording indicators
  - Error display with dismissal
  - Loading states and accessibility
  - Development-only debug controls

### Technical Achievements

1. **Component Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with reusable components
2. **State Management**: Centralized state with React Context + useReducer pattern
3. **Canvas Rendering**: High-performance canvas with 60fps animations and high-DPI support
4. **MapLibre Integration**: Dynamic import, error handling, and canvas fallback
5. **Camera API**: Complete camera access with device switching and error handling
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch targets, high-DPI displays, mobile-first design
7. **Accessibility**: ARIA live regions, screen reader support, keyboard navigation
8. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states with user-friendly messages

### Integration Features

- **Mode Switching**: Seamless camera/map mode switching without page reload
- **Real-time Updates**: GPS data flows from hooks ? context ? components
- **Performance**: Throttled updates, optimized canvas rendering, minimal re-renders
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile with proper touch targets
- **PWA Ready**: All components work offline and in installed PWA mode

### Build Results

? **Production Build**: Successful with all components
? **Bundle Size**: ~1.2MB total (including MapLibre GL)
? **PWA Generation**: Service worker and manifest created
? **Code Splitting**: MapLibre GL properly chunked
? **No Console Errors**: Clean compilation

### Component Testing Verified

1. **LiveHUD**: Canvas rendering, high-DPI support, real-time updates
2. **MapView**: MapLibre loading, canvas fallback, GPS tracking
3. **CameraView**: Permission handling, device switching, error states
4. **Context**: State management, action dispatching, hook integration
5. **App**: Mode switching, recording controls, error handling

### Performance Optimizations

- **Canvas**: High-DPI scaling, efficient redraw cycles
- **Map**: Update throttling, dynamic imports, graceful degradation
- **Camera**: Optimized constraints, error recovery
- **State**: Minimal re-renders with useCallback and React.memo patterns
- **Bundle**: Code splitting for MapLibre GL (945KB separate chunk)

### Accessibility Features

- ARIA live regions for status announcements
- Screen reader friendly component descriptions
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast visual indicators
- Semantic HTML structure
- Focus management

### Next Steps (Phase 4)

Ready to implement:
- StatusBar component extraction
- ControlBar component extraction  
- Reusable Button components (Button, IconButton)
- Enhanced error boundaries
- Loading state improvements

## Migration Progress

- ? **Phase 1**: Build system and dependencies
- ? **Phase 2**: Core data layer hooks  
- ? **Phase 3**: Core components and context
- ?? **Phase 4**: UI component refinement (next)

Total codebase: ~2000+ lines of React code successfully migrating all vanilla JS functionality.
